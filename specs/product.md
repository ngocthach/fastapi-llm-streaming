# LLM Streaming Service Specification

## Vision

Provide a simple, reliable backend service that streams responses from a Large Language Model (LLM), stores conversation history, and makes it accessible for review and future improvements. The system should be lightweight, easy to debug, and maintainable even for new developers or interns.

## User Personas

* **Developer/Engineer**: Needs an API to test, debug, and extend LLM functionality in projects.
* **Product Owner/Reviewer**: Needs to review conversation history to evaluate system behavior and identify improvements.

## Core Features

### Streaming Endpoint

* **User story**: As a developer, I want to send a prompt and receive the response chunk-by-chunk so I can display it in real time.
* **Acceptance criteria**:

  * Accepts JSON: `{"prompt": "some text"}`.
  * Returns streaming response in chunks.
  * Full response saved to database after completion with prompt + timestamp.
* **Business rules**:

  * Only text input is accepted.
  * Streaming must handle errors gracefully (timeouts, malformed requests).

### Conversation History

* **User story**: As a product owner, I want to review past conversations so I can understand model performance.
* **Acceptance criteria**:

  * Stores prompt, response, timestamp.
  * Provides endpoint to fetch past conversation history.
* **Business rules**:

  * Data must be persisted (not in-memory only).
  * History retrieval limited to reasonable page size.

### Documentation & Review

* **User story**: As a reviewer, I want a clear explanation of design and improvement ideas.
* **Acceptance criteria**:

  * Document design decisions.
  * Provide list of potential improvements.
* **Business rules**:

  * Documentation must be simple enough for onboarding interns.

## Non-functional Requirements

* **Performance**: Must handle streaming with minimal latency (< 500ms per chunk).
* **Security**: Validate request payloads, sanitize inputs, and prevent injection attacks.
* **Scalability**: Service should support multiple concurrent streams without data loss.
* **Reliability**: Must save conversation even if streaming fails midway.
* **Maintainability**: Code should be simple, readable, and easy to debug by new team members.
